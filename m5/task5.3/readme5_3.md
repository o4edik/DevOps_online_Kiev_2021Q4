### Module 5. Linux Essentials.
#### Taks 5.3
##### Part 1

1. How many states could has a process in Linux?

 - It could be have next  states:
               D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
               I    Idle kernel thread
               R    running or runnable (on run queue)
               S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
               T    stopped by job control signal
               t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
               W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
               X    dead (should never be seen)
               Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent


2. Examine the pstree command. Make output (highlight) the chain (ancestors) of the current
process.

 - For highlighting current process we use "pstree -h"

3. What is a proc file system?

 - It's a virtual file system created on fly when system boots and is dissolved at time of system shut down.
It contains useful information about the processes that are currently running, it is regarded as control and information center for kernel. The proc file system also provides communication medium between kernel space and user space.

4. Print information about the processor (its type, supported technologies, etc.).

 - For getting info about processor we'll use "lscpu" as shown below

 ![4]()

5. Use the ps command to get information about the process. The information should be as
follows: the owner of the process, the arguments with which the process was launched for
execution, the group owner of this process, etc.

6. How to define kernel processes and user processes?

 - We can define them via UID as shown delow UID = 1000 that means it belongs to user, as we know kernelprocesses has an UID range 1 -100

7. Print the list of processes to the terminal. Briefly describe the statuses of the processes.
What condition are they in, or can they be arriving in?

 - For output list of processes to the terminal, we'll use "top" command, here what we have as we take for example first row of screenshot below

  - PID=104817, PR(priority)=20, NI(nice)=0, VIRT=3443088 amount of virtual memory used by process, RES=699572 amount of resident memory used by the process, SHR=115836 amount of shared memory used by the process, S=R(running) status of the process, %CPU=102.0 the share of CPU time used by the process since the last update, %MEM=8.8 the share of physical memory used, TIME+ =34:34.24 total CPU time used by the task in hundredths of a second, COMMAND=Web Content command name or command line 

8. Display only the processes of a specific user.
 - for show processes of a specific user name "ed" we will take "top -u ed"

9. What utilities can be used to analyze existing running tasks (by analyzing the help for the ps command)?

 - 

10. What information does top command display?

 - The "top" command displays us the next information: PID, PR(priority)=, NI(nice), VIRT amount of virtual memory used by process, RES amount of resident memory used by the process, SHR amount of shared memory used by the process, S status of the process, %CPU the share of CPU time used by the process since the last update, %MEM the share of physical memory used, TIME+  total CPU time used by the task in hundredths of a second, COMMAND Content command name or command line 

12. Display the processes of the specific user using the top command.
12. What interactive commands can be used to control the top command? Give a couple of
examples.
13. Sort the contents of the processes window using various parameters (for example, the
amount of processor time taken up, etc.)
14. Concept of priority, what commands are used to set priority?
15. Can I change the priority of a process using the top command? If so, how?
16. Examine the kill command. How to send with the kill command
process control signal? Give an example of commonly used signals.
17. Commands jobs, fg, bg, nohup. What are they for? Use the sleep, yes command to
demonstrate the process control mechanism with fg, bg.

##### Part 2

1. Check the implementability of the most frequently used OPENSSH commands in the MS
Windows operating system. (Description of the expected result of the commands +
screenshots: command â€“ result should be presented)
2. Implement basic SSH settings to increase the security of the client-server connection (at least
3. List the options for choosing keys for encryption in SSH. Implement 3 of them.
4. Implement port forwarding for the SSH client from the host machine to the guest Linux
virtual machine behind NAT.
5*. Intercept (capture) traffic (tcpdump, wireshark) while authorizing the remote client on the
server using ssh, telnet, rlogin. Analyze the result.

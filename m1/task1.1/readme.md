DevOps it's something like a "logist" and "supply chain manager" in one person.
Devops should arrange that everything will flows smoothly, no interruption all stuff that needs for processes in project must be
delivered and deployed in time and in proper configuration, any teammate shouldn't feel uncomfortable during their job doing. 
DevOps have to be on the edge of technoliges using on project it really will helps him and whole project.
